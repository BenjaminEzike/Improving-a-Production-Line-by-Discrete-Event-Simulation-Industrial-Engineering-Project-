# Improving a Production Line by Discrete Event Simulation (Industrial Engineering Project)

This is a dicrete event simulation done on Arena Software. It is based on a 'Garden Dwarf' manufacturing company with a present manufacturing capacity of about 1000 units per week. However, due to sales growth, the company wants to evaluate their production line's ability to meet future demand of 1100 units per week, and subsequently 1250 units per week. What equipment on the line should be changed or added to achieve this and justifications?. Possilbe Solutions evaluated include:

- Hiring of more workers
- Not hiring of addition worker, but addition of overtime for present workers.
- Purchase of addition equipment for a particular stage.
- Addition of Kanbans. 

The model is built on Arena. Using an avaiable production data over a 50 days period, the model output data is validated against this available data using a t-test. The warm-up period and replication lenghts are also calculated in the report. 

Acknowledgment: This was a project done with my colleague/classmate, Sana Akbar, who did most of the report writing, while I had to build and evaluate the model.
